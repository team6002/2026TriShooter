| Intake    | Roller Lead       | 12     | NEO VORTEX |
| Intake    | Roller Follower   | 1      | NEO VORTEX |
| Shooter   | Left Shooter      | 3      | NEO V1     |
| Shooter   | Middle Shooter    | 4      | NEO V1     |
| Shooter   | Right Shooter     | 17     | NEO V1     |
| Hood      | Hood              | 2      | NEO 550    |
| Conveyor  | Conveyor          | 13     | NEO V1     |
| Kicker    | Kicker            | 16     | NEO V1     |

**Note:** All motor controllers use a CAN ID matching their PDH slot. The only exception is PDH slot 0, which uses CAN ID 62 because motor controllers cannot be assigned CAN ID 0.

## Build, Deploy, & Simulate

### Building the code

You can build the robot code in two ways

- Using WPILib VsCode:
 Press Ctrl + Shift + P, then search for 
 `WPILib: Build Robot Code`
- Using Gradle
`./gradlew build`

### Deploying the code

Similarly there are two ways to deploy the code to a robot

- Using WPILib VsCode: Press Ctrl + Shift + P, then search for
 `WPILib: Deploy Robot Code`

- Using Gradle `./gradlew deploy`

### Simulating the code

You can also simulate the robot code with two methods

- Using WPILib VsCode:
Press Ctrl + Shift + P, search for 
`WPILib: Simulate Robot Code `, and then choose:
  - Sim GUI if you don’t have the NI Game Tools installed
  - Real Driver Station if you want to use the official NI Driver Station

- Using Gradle: `./gradlew simulateJava`
